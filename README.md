# efundamentals-reviews

This project investigates the field of Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA)
on e-commerce product reviews, through multi-label classification and VADER, a
lexicon and rule-based sentiment analyser. It compares Machine Learning Multilabel
problem transformation methods, with Deep Neural Networks and a rulebased
classifier, for aspect classification using statistical testing and evaluation
metrics tailored to the data distribution. Then best performing method is combined
with VADER, creating review tokens that contain both a label and sentiment
score.


The data acquisition is done in the pipeline totebook, along with tokenisation and filtering, (sections are annotated), and eventually traning and testin gneural networks.

Data pre-procssing is done on the .py files, with MARS being the application of the final method.
